# Kickoff changelog
All latest changes are documented on our site at http://tmwagency.github.io/kickoff/

## Version 4.0.0
### Typography
 * Font sizes use a modular scale throughout (but can easily be overridden)
 * Sass vars fonts etc are shorter and more intuitive to use - hopefully they'll be easier to remember when developing.
 * Added simple responsive type to reduce the font size on smaller viewports. Modify `$font-size-base-narrow` in `scss/_variables.css` to change this.

### Sass
* All of the CSS3 mixins have been removed because we use [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/nDmitry/grunt-autoprefixer)
* **Global Sass vars** (`_variables.css`)
 * Breakpoint vars have been shortened from `$breakpoint-*` to `$bp-*`
 * Some of the grid vars have been moved to the more generic, `$layout-*` because they are not explicitly to do with the grid.
 * Other minor tweaks have also been made, so please read through this file to understand them.

### Javascript
* We have removed many of the old 'helper' files and plugins, instead opting for dependencies found on the [Bower](http://bower.io) registry.
* Bower dependencies are installed to `js/bower`. To change this, edit the `.bowerrc` file. The default dependencies that we suggest are [Swiftclick](), [Trak.js]() and [Cookies]()
* [Shimly](http://github.com/nicbell/shimly), a grunt plugin by [Nic Bell](http://github.com/nicbell) is being used to generate a file of javascript shims. Have a look at `_grunt-configs/javascript.js` to find the Shimly settings.

### Grunt & tooling
* [Livereload](http://livereload.com/) & [grunt-contrib-connect](https://github.com/grunt-contrib-connect) have been dropped (but still included) in favour of [BrowserSync](http://www.browsersync.io/docs/grunt/) (which handles both without a browser extension) for our live CSS updating and simple server needs. Running `grunt serve` will fire up a simple server and watch for changes, with the added benefits of [BrowserSync's](http://www.browsersync.io/docs/grunt/) many features.
* All grunt tasks have been moved into grouped separate files in the `_grunt-configs` folder. For example, `_grunt-configs/css.js` contains all the grunt tasks relating to CSS: Sass, [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/nDmitry/grunt-autoprefixer) & [CSSO](https://github.com/t32k/grunt-csso) (for minifying CSS. The `_grunt-configs/javascript.js` file contains the uglify (for concatenating and minfying js), shimly (for generating a javascript shims file), jshint and jQuery (for generating a custom jQuery build).
* Extra grunt tasks have been added to help development. For example, running `grunt icons` will rebuild all the icons generated by Grunticon. `grunt start` will bring up a browser window with our 'getting started' guide, it also contains the simple styleguide for your project.
